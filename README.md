## Overview

This image search engine leverages the power of ChromaDB, Streamlit, and CLIP to enable efficient and visually appealing exploration of image collections. ChromaDB provides a robust database for storing and managing image embeddings, while Streamlit acts as the intuitive web-based interface. CLIP, a highly effective multimodal embedding model, forms the core of the search functionality.

## Features

- Image search by text query: Leverage CLIP's text-image understanding to find images similar to your descriptive input.
- Grid-based visual results: Streamlit presents search results in a clear grid layout, providing an informative overview of relevant images.
- Interactive image information: Click on any image to access its additional details (location, distance, etc.).
- Customizable embedding function: Choose the ideal way to represent your images for search using ChromaDB's flexible embedding framework.
- Scalable architecture: The system can handle growing image collections efficiently, thanks to ChromaDB's database capabilities.

## Architecture

- Frontend: Streamlit creates the user interface, receiving search queries and displaying results.
- Backend: ChromaDB stores image embeddings and meta-data, efficiently retrieving relevant images based on queries.
- Embedding function: CLIP generates image embeddings for search and comparison.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Streamlit
- ChromaDB
- Hugging Face transformers library (CLIP integration)
- (Optional) Additional libraries for specific functionalities

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install the required dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Configure your database connection in `database.ini`.
4. Replace the example image paths in `data.py` with your actual image locations.
5. Run the application: `streamlit run app.py`.
6. Use the text input field to enter your search query and explore the results.
